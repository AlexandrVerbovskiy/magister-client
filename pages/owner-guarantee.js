            <h3>RentAbout Owner Protection Plan</h3>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p className="mb-1">
              This protection plan is governed by our General Terms of Service
              and Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h4>What Does This Plan Cover?</h4>
            <p>
              Your listed items are protected against damage that occurs during
              the rental period. Coverage applies to each item up to its
              replacement value, provided the item’s value does not exceed the
              specified limits and meets the criteria in this document. Coverage
              limits are £1,500 in the UK.
            </p>

            <h4>What is Not Covered?</h4>
            <p>We will not cover the following:</p>
            <p className="mb-0">Damage:</p>
            <div className="p-0">

                <li>
                  Resulting from inherent defects, such as corrosion, pest
                  damage, humidity, or extreme temperatures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Linked to pre-existing damage, including structural issues
                  from prior impacts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Caused by prior modifications, such as extensions, cleaning,
                  repairs, or restorations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Due to normal wear and tear that doesn’t impair the item's
                  functionality.
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>

                  protective covers, such as lens caps or cases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Due to lack of regular maintenance or servicing of the item.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To items classified as “vintage” or no longer in circulation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minor cosmetic damage that does not affect functionality, such

                </li>
                <li>

            <p>
              Public or product liability incidents, such as injury or property
              damage caused by your equipment during a RentAbout rental.

            <p>
              Real estate, motorhomes, campervans, people, services, chemicals,

            <p>Items that are still under a claim process.</p>
            <p>Items handed over to anyone other than the verified Renter.</p>
            <p>
              Items handed over during the exchange process that do not follow
              the barcode and verification of condition process from both the
              Owner and the Renter. RentAbout cannot guarantee where no damage
              or other issues were reported as part of that process at the time
              of the exchange.
            </p>

            <h4>Compensation Details</h4>
            <p>
              We will pay for repair costs, replacement value, or original value
              (considering depreciation), whichever is less. The "original
              value" is based on your proof of purchase. Depreciation is
              determined by our Claims Team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Customer Service Team will decide whether an item can be
              reasonably repaired or is irreparable. If uncertain, you may need
              to obtain a third-party appraisal.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Customer Service Team will determine when to initiate the
              claims process, after compensation has been sought from the
              Renter.
            </p>

            <h4>Owner Responsibilities</h4>

              We will only make payment under this protection plan if you:

            <div className="p-0">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Seek compensation from the Renter for any damage, loss, or
                  theft during the rental period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In case of theft, report the incident to the police promptly
                  and obtain a crime reference number.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Include all items in your original listing used by the Renter

                </li>
                <li>
                  Ensure the estimated value is accurate within a 10% margin.

                <li>
                  Provide necessary documentation to support the claim, such as:

                    <li>An itemized breakdown of damages or losses.</li>
                    <li>Proof of purchase value.</li>

                      to prove the condition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Refrain from posting information about your claim on
                      social media or online before the claim process is
                      completed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If your items are business-owned, you must first try to
                      claim on your existing insurance before claiming under
                      this protection plan. Provide written evidence if the
                      claim is denied.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the item is under warranty, attempt to use it to cover
                      repairs or replacements before making a claim under this
                      plan. Provide written evidence if the warranty claim is
                      denied.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Report any incident that may lead to a claim within 24
                      hours of the rental end date.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Provide all required information for the claim within 3
                      months of initiating the process. Failure to do so will
                      result in the claim being closed.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
